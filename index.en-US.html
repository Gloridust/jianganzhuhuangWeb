                    Bamboo grows abundantly in Jiang'an. Bamboo as a means of livelihood has long been a tradition, but bamboo reed is not an indigenous craft of Jiang'an. In 1889, Shen Bingkun, a native of Hunan Province, introduced the bamboo reed craft from Shaoyang, Hunan Province, when he served as the magistrate of Jiang'an, thus linking the historical origins between the two bamboo-producing regions of Hunan and Sichuan. Since then, the bamboo reed craft has merged with local bamboo crafts and flourished. During the Republic of China period, bamboo art factories were established in Jiang'an. After the 1950s, Jiang'an formed dozens of large and small factories represented by bamboo reed craft factories and bamboo chopstick craft factories, reaching its peak in the 1970s and 1980s of the 20th century.

                    On the Winter Solstice, several bamboo trees were cut from the South Screen Mountain, nicknamed the "back garden" by the people of Jiang'an, as raw materials for bamboo reed carving. Bamboo cutting on the Winter Solstice is less prone to insect infestation. With four to five years of growth, the sturdy and robust Phyllostachys nuda bamboo is cut down on the same day and transported down the mountain the next day. After sawing into bamboo tubes, the outer skin and inner bamboo flesh are removed, leaving only the inner wall.

                    This layer of inner wall, about two millimeters thick, is what artisans call bamboo reed, also known as bamboo reed or reed piece. After steaming or high-temperature baking, in the battle of water, fire, and bamboo, after the arc is turned into a plane, it can be pasted onto other bamboo or wood materials to start carving, smoking, inlaying, etc., to complete bamboo reed crafts. In Jiang'an, bamboo reed craft narrowly refers to bamboo reed carving, while broadly encompassing all bamboo crafts in Jiang'an.
