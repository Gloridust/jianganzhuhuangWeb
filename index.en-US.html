                    In the "Authentic Localities" section of China National Geographic, the article delves into the tradition of bamboo reed crafts in Jiang'an. Bamboo has long been abundant in Jiang'an, and while the craft of bamboo reed carving was not originally indigenous to the region, it was introduced by Shen Bingkun, a native of Hunan Province, who served as the magistrate of Jiang'an in 1889. He brought the craft from Shaoyang, Hunan, thus establishing a historical connection between the bamboo regions of Hunan and Sichuan. Subsequently, the craft of bamboo reed carving merged with local bamboo craftsmanship and flourished. By the time of the Republic of China, bamboo art factories had already been established in Jiang'an. After the 1950s, Jiang'an saw the rise of dozens of small and large factories specializing in bamboo reed crafts, bamboo chopsticks, and other bamboo products, reaching its peak in the 1970s and 1980s.

                    During the Winter Solstice, known as the "backyard" by the people of Jiang'an, several bamboo trees are cut down from the Nanping Mountain to serve as raw materials for bamboo reed carving. Bamboo cut during the Winter Solstice is less prone to insect infestations. The selected bamboo, which is four to five years old and sturdy, is cut down one day and transported down the mountain the next. After being sawn into bamboo tubes, the outer skin and inner flesh are removed, leaving only the inner wall intact.

                    This inner layer, about two millimeters thick, is what artisans refer to as bamboo reed or bamboo reed slices. The reeds are steamed or baked at high temperatures. Through the interplay of water, fire, and bamboo, they undergo a transition from a curved shape to a flat one. They are then affixed to other bamboo or wooden materials and carved, smoked, and inlaid to create various bamboo reed crafts. In Jiang'an, bamboo reed artwork narrowly refer to bamboo reed carving but broadly encompass all bamboo reed artwork in the region.
